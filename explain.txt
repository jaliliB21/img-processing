Face recognition and facial expressions are done with Deep Face. 
I uploaded a picture with two faces, it correctly recognized the two faces by their facial expressions, 
but it recognized a third face, which was the elbow of one of the people who was also wearing clothes, which is completely wrong. 


In the second file:face_detection_2.py
I fixed the problem of the first part and it recognized only two faces, 
which was completely correct, but when I uploaded a picture of 4, 
it considered the three images as one and finally recognized two faces, 
one of which was completely correct.
The second face is relatively correct, but the other two faces were not recognized, 
one of the reasons was that the faces were close to each other


In the file: face_detection_3.py
I fixed the previous problem, 
which included pre-processing such as resizing and then reducing the noise with a Gaussian filter and using a better model, 
which finally recognized 4 faces correctly and the facial expressions were almost correct.
