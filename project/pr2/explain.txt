Project: Face Emotion and Eye Color Detection using DeepFace and Dlib
======================================================================

Overview:
---------
This project analyzes a given image containing one or more human faces. For each detected face, it performs the following tasks:

1. Detects the face using Dlib's frontal face detector.
2. Identifies facial landmarks (points) using the 'shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat' model.
3. Extracts the eye regions based on these landmarks.
4. Estimates the eye color by calculating the average RGB values within the eye region.
5. Detects the dominant emotion of the face using DeepFace.
6. Labels each face with a number in the image and prints emotion and eye color information to the terminal.

Requirements:
-------------
- Python libraries: `dlib`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `deepface`
- File: `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat`
  - This is a pretrained model provided by Dlib that detects 68 facial landmark points including eyes, nose, lips, and jawline.
  - Download from: http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2

How It Works:
-------------
1. **Face Detection (Dlib)**:
   - Uses a HOG-based detector to find face rectangles in the image.

2. **Facial Landmark Detection**:
   - The 68-point predictor identifies key locations on the face.
   - Eye coordinates are derived from points 36-41 (left eye) and 42-47 (right eye).

3. **Eye Color Detection**:
   - Bounding rectangles are computed around each eye.
   - The average color inside the eye area is calculated using NumPy.
   - A set of basic rules maps RGB averages to color names (e.g., brown, blue, green).

4. **Emotion Detection**:
   - DeepFace analyzes the cropped face image using its pretrained model (default: VGG-Face or similar).
   - It outputs the dominant facial emotion such as "happy", "angry", "neutral", etc.

5. **Output**:
   - The image displays each face with a number (1, 2, ...).
   - Terminal output shows detailed information:
     Example:
       [Face 1] Emotion: happy | Eye Color: brown
       [Face 2] Emotion: neutral | Eye Color: green

Note:
-----
- The `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` is critical for detecting the eyes.
- Eye color detection is approximate and may be affected by lighting and image quality.
